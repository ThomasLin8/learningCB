# Environment-Aware Codebooks
Learning environment-aware and hardware-compatible mmWave beam-forming codebooks using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Please refer to [Learning Beam Codebooks with Neural Networks: Towards Environment-Aware mmWave MIMO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10663) for more details.

# Requirment:

1-Keras with Theano backend.

2-Numpy library.

3-Python 3.6 or above.

Optional:

1- MATLAB for data preperation. 

# Note:
The implementation of the complex-valued fully-connected layer is guided by that in [Deep Complex Nets](https://github.com/ChihebTrabelsi/deep_complex_networks) with some modifications.
